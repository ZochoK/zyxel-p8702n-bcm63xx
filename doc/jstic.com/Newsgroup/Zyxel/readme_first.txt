Dear downloader ;o)

If we can share infos, this is because many friends gave me infos 
and emailed me them.

It would be wonderful if you could post me the comments and files 
that could increase the library of data we could collect about Zyxels.

Thank you in advance,

Best regards,

Small How to...

I bought the cable on ebay, in spain. You have them for 10 euro, and you also have a picture on the link (http://www.jstic.com/Newsgroup/Zyxel/) to do this cable. I bought it, as it was easier ;o)

Then you have to do as explained on the PDF file, you have to download the bootroom from your modem, and with a software (you see the exe) iHex you can modify the 2 Feature bytes you see (eg. 92 4F for Arcor).

You will find these bytes at the location in the bootrom : 3FD8 and 3FD9

You change them then with the right feature bits you want, you can find on the list here :

And then you reflash the Bootroom (I forget to tell it !).

You can find the process in the pdf files, depending of your modem model.
